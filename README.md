# Introducing FakeApi: A Versatile API for Testing and Development

In the world of software development, having access to reliable and versatile APIs for testing and development purposes is crucial. Developers often find themselves in need of mock APIs that can simulate real-world scenarios and provide the flexibility to work with different data formats. That's why I'm excited to introduce **FakeApi**, a feature-rich API service designed to meet the diverse needs of developers.

## Overview

**FakeApi** is a robust API service built using the .NET 8 framework (similar to .NET 5 or .NET 6) that addresses the limitations of existing public APIs. One of its standout features is its ability to support both JSON and XML responses, giving developers the flexibility they need for various testing and development scenarios.

### Key Features:

1. **Dual Response Format:**
   - **JSON:** Get responses in JSON format.
   - **XML:** Receive responses in XML format.

2. **Data Storage and Retrieval:**
   - The API has the capability to store modified data, allowing developers to work with custom datasets.
   - Responses are stored for each IP, making it easy to retrieve modified data for 30 minutes per user.
